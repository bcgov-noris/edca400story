        <h2>Why is storytelling such a powerful tool in adult education?</h1>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p class="lead">This presentation explores Merriam and Baumgartner's Chapter 9 section on Narrative Learning
            (2020, pp.
            256-266). In the text, the authors use Clark's (2010) definition: "narrative learning means learning
            through
            stories" (as cited in Merriam & Baumgartner, 2020, p. 257).</p>
          <p>While this presentation centres on my belief in the power of story, my other core
            beliefs also connect to narrative learning.</p>
          <h4>My core beliefs</h4>
          <dl class="row">
            <dt class="col-2 text-end">Agency</dt>
            <dd class="col-10">I believe that education is an invitation and technology can help learners respond on
              their
              own terms.</dd>
            <dt class="col-2 text-end">Connection</dt>
            <dd class="col-10"> I believe that relationship, emotional safety, and a sense of belonging are
              foundational to meaningful learning. </dd>
            <dt class="col-2 text-end">Resilience</dt>
            <dd class="col-10">I believe that learning is messy and often requires starting over or changing
              direction.</dd>
            <dt class="col-2 text-end">Purpose</dt>
            <dd class="col-10"> I believe that learning should give people the tools, skills, and confidence to
              translate
              knowledge into thoughtful action.
            </dd>
            <dt class="col-2 text-end">Story</dt>
            <dd class="col-10"> I believe that learning is most effective when storytelling is intentionally
              incorporated, helping learners connect with ideas through real-life examples, reflections, and simple
              narratives.

                    Hernandez-Serrano,
                    2002, p. 66), and they have a place in adult learning because stories enable us to make meaning of
                    our
                    lives." <br>

                <ul>
                  <li>Our lives are made up of stories: our memories, our dreams, our beliefs. If learning can tap into
                    this
                    core
                    human experience, it is more likely to have a lasting impact.</li>
                  <li>Along with embodied and spiritual learning, narrative learning is part of the nonscientific. It is
                    more
                    concerned with human meaning than discrete facts or logic (Merriam & Baumgartner, 2020, p. 257)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Core belief: Story</h4>
                <p> This element of narrative learning ties into my core belief of story. I get excited by the possible
                  benefits of incorporating story-telling into my course design. I want learners to pause and make sense
                  of how new ideas fit with what they already know or believe, and how their own story might be
                  changing.
                </p>
                <p></p>As Daloz (2012) states, "A good story transforms our vision of the possible and provides us with
                a
                map for the journey ahead" (as cited in Merriam & Baumgartner, 2020, p. 173). </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Rossiter and Clark (2007) organize narrative into four types: cultural, familial, individual, and
                    organizational (as cited in Merriam & Baumgartner, 2020, p. 257)
                    <ul>
                      <li>Cultural narratives: the ideas that we take for granted, that we are immersed in, invisible
                        like the
                        air
                        we breathe (Merriam & Baumgartner, 2020, p. 257)</li>
                      <li>Family narratives: values and beliefs, customs, roles and rituals (Merriam & Baumgartner,
                        2020, p.
                        258)</li>
                      <li>Individual narratives: the stories we create about our own lives. When incorporating
                        reflection, this
                        can
                        be empowering (Merriam & Baumgartner, 2020, p. 258)</li>
                      <li>Organizational narratives: stories also structure meaning within the organizations in our
                        society
                        (Merriam & Baumgartner, 2020, p. 258)</li>

                <h4>Core belief: Purpose</h4>
                <p>Along with my core belief around story, the types and layers of narrative connect with my core belief
                  of purpose. In my work in corporate learning, I often have to navigate the
                  tension between learner needs and organizational goals. The stories that we tell ourselves and each
                  other can help shift an organizational narrative and drive lasting impact.</p>

                    "Using stories to engage students in ideas that are part of course content may be the only way to
                    allow
                    understanding to occur. It is also a powerful means of making connections not only with ideas but
                    with
                    other learners, perhaps ultimately creating a learning community. Whether these stories are

                    by
                    students themselves, are case studies, or are fictional accounts, they draw us in, they allow us to

                  <li>De Groot (2018) names four modes of narrative learning: learning from narratives/stories, learning
                    through narrating one's own story, learning by recognizing that one's citizenship identity is
                    narratively
                    constituted, and "learning to position existing societal and cultural narratives in their cultural
                    and
                    historical context" (as cited in Merriam & Baumgartner, 2020, p. 259).</li>
                  <li>Rossiter and Clark (2007) identify three modes in which stories appear in practice: "storying" the
                    curriculum, storytelling, and autobiography" (as cited in Merriam & Baumgartner, 2020, p. 259).</li>
                  <li>Jonassen and Hernandez-Serrano (2002) discuss how things like case studies and scenarios can
                    expand
                    our
                    understanding (as cited in Merriam & Baumgartner, 2020, p. 260).</li>

                <h4>Core belief: Connection</h4>

                <p>These examples of narrative learning types also support my core belief of connection. In
                  my
                  role, I rarely work in direct contact with learners. While I can include prompts and case studies that
                  reflect warmth and compassion, I can't always create emotional safety through live interaction. I find
                  it
                  helpful to remember that learning relationships can be formed in all types of interactions, even
                  asynchronous ones.</p>

                <h4>Core belief: Resilience</h4>
                <p>This element of self-reflection is closely tied to my core belief of resilience. Change is a normal
                  and necessary part
                  of
                  learning design, not a sign of failure. Confidence and growth are built by working through problems
                  with
                  self-compassion, not avoiding them because it's not perfect the first time.</p>

                <h4>Core belief: Agency</h4>

                <p>With its deeply personal element of self-reflection or restorying, I find this aspect of narrative
                  learning to connect with my core belief of agency. To bring this into my practice, I try to
                  offer a
                  variety of learning activities so that everyone can find something that meets their needs.</p>

                  includes
                  both experimental learning (the result of a person experimenting on the environment) and reflective
                  practice (thinking about and monitoring one's practice as it is happening) with what he conceives as
                  the
                  highest forms of learning (as cited in Merriam & Baumgartner, 2020, p. 203). I look for ways to
                  incorporate both types of learning into the large-scale, asynchronous courses I design.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Why Story Matters for Adult Education</h2>

            "Narratives are stories, "the oldest and most natural form of sense making" (Jonassen &
            Hernandez-Serrano,
            2002, p. 66), and they have a place in adult learning because stories enable us to make meaning of our
            lives" <br>
            <span class="d-block small text-end"><em>(Merriam & Baumgartner, 2020, p. 257)</em></span>
          </p>
          <i class="bi bi-quote ms-3" style="font-size: 6rem; color:#414288; line-height: 1; rotate: 180deg;"></i>

        <p>"To summarize this section on narrative learning, it is clear that adult educators have a means of
          facilitating
          learning that all adults can relate to—stories that surround us, that define us, that we can construct,
          analyze,
          reflect upon, and learn from. Stories can be used to understand content, ourselves, and the world in which we
          live. Narratives are also windows into development and transformational learning. They enable us to make sense
          of
          our experience, which is what adult learning is all about." (Merriam & Baumgartner, 2020, p. 266)</p>
        <p>I can't think of anything that drives adult learning more than storytelling. It is tricky to include aspects
          of
          narrative learning in course design as it doesn't fit neatly into a box. There is no exact formula for how to
          incorporate stories in my work in corporate learning.</p>
        <p>But when it is used successfully, learning has the potential to reach the level of what Cajete describes:
          "Education has been, and continues to be, a grand story, a search for meaning, and an essential food for the
          soul"
          (2010, p. 1131, as cited in Merriam & Baumgartner, 2020, p. 61). This is the kind of soul-feeding learning I
          aspire to create in my practice.</p>
